## Why Droid-Shield Blocked?

Droid-Shield detected these strings in documentation files:
- `.env.example`: `"your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production"`
- `docker-compose.yml`: `POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres`

These are **safe placeholders** for documentation - not real secrets.

See `SECURITY_REVIEW.md` for detailed analysis.
