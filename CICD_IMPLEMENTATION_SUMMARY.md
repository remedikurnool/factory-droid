```

### 2. Enable Workflows
```bash
# Workflows will auto-enable on first push
# Or manually enable in: Actions tab → Select workflow → Enable
```

### 3. Test the Pipeline
```bash
# Create a test branch
git checkout -b test/ci-pipeline

# Make a small change
echo "# Test" >> test.md
git add test.md
git commit -m "test(ci): verify CI pipeline"
git push origin test/ci-pipeline

# Create a PR and watch the workflows run
```

### 4. Monitor Builds
- Go to **Actions** tab to see running workflows
- Click on any workflow to see detailed logs
- Check **Security** tab for vulnerability reports

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Creating a PR

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### CI Failures
```bash
# Check workflow logs
# Go to Actions → Failed workflow → View logs

# Common issues:
1. Linting errors → Run locally: pnpm run lint --fix
2. Test failures → Run locally: pnpm test
3. Build errors → Check TypeScript: pnpm run build
```

### Deployment Failures
```bash
# Check deployment logs
# Common issues:
1. Missing secrets → Verify in Settings
2. Migration errors → Check database connection
3. Health check fails → Verify service is running
```
