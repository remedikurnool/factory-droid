# ONE MEDI - Detailed Phase-Wise Implementation Plan
## Enterprise-Grade Production-Ready Healthcare Platform

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: October 8, 2025  
**Project Status**: Foundation Complete - Moving to Production Implementation

---

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### ✅ Completed (Foundation Phase)
- **Backend Infrastructure**: NestJS API with 14 modules, Prisma ORM, JWT auth, RBAC
- **Database Schema**: 30+ comprehensive models covering all features
- **Frontend/Admin Setup**: Next.js 15.5.4 + React 19 skeleton applications
- **Architecture**: Monorepo with Turborepo, pnpm workspaces

### ❌ Gaps Identified (Production Requirements)
- **Frontend**: Only basic homepage - 95% of UI components missing
- **Admin Panel**: Only skeleton - 100% of dashboard features missing
- **Backend**: API structure exists but missing implementation details, validation, error handling
- **Testing**: 0% test coverage - no unit, integration, or e2e tests
- **Security**: Basic JWT - missing rate limiting, API keys, audit logs
- **Payment**: Razorpay structure - not implemented
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO module - no implementation
- **File Upload**: Multer configured - no validation or storage
- **Monitoring**: No logging, metrics, or alerting
- **CI/CD**: No automated pipelines
- **Performance**: No caching, optimization, or CDN
- **Compliance**: No GDPR, data privacy, or healthcare regulations
