## 📝 Merge Strategy

### Recommended Approach: **Squash and Merge**

**Why Squash and Merge?**
1. Creates clean commit history on main
2. All 27 commits become one comprehensive commit
3. Easier to revert if needed
4. Main branch stays clean and readable

**Steps to Merge:**

1. **Review This PR**
   - Check all changes in GitHub PR interface
   - Review each file category
   - Verify no sensitive data exposed

2. **Run Final Tests** (in staging environment)
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   npm run install:all
   
   # Setup environment
   npm run setup:env
   
   # Run builds
   npm run build
   
   # Run tests (if available)
   npm test
   ```

3. **Merge to Main** (via GitHub UI)
   - Go to Pull Request in GitHub
   - Select "Squash and merge"
   - Edit commit message if needed
   - Click "Confirm squash and merge"

4. **Verify Main Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git log -1  # Should show your squashed commit
   ```

5. **Deploy to Production**
   - Trigger deployment pipeline
   - Monitor deployment logs
   - Verify health checks
   - Test critical paths

---

## 🔍 Verification Steps

### After Merge, Verify:

1. **Code Integrity**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git log --graph --oneline -20
   git diff HEAD~1 HEAD --stat
   ```

2. **Build Successfully**
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   npm run setup:env
   # Verify .env.local files created
   ```

4. **Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Check http://localhost:3000 (Frontend)
   # Check http://localhost:3001 (Admin)
   ```

5. **Production Build**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   # Verify production builds work
   ```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Breaking Changes
- None - This is initial major release

### Database Migrations
- Run Prisma migrations before deploying
- Backup database before migration
- Test migrations in staging first

### Environment Variables Required
**Frontend (.env.local)**:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:4000
```

**Admin (.env.local)**:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### Security Considerations
- All API keys stored in environment variables
- No secrets committed to repository
- CORS properly configured
- Rate limiting enabled
- JWT tokens secure
