## 📦 Dependencies Added

Payment and file handling dependencies (should be added to package.json):
```json
{
  "razorpay": "^2.9.2",
  "@nestjs/platform-socket.io": "^10.3.0",
  "socket.io": "^4.6.1",
  "pdfkit": "^0.13.0",
  "@types/pdfkit": "^0.12.12"
}
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Payment Flow
1. Frontend requests order creation
2. Backend creates Razorpay order
3. Frontend displays Razorpay checkout
4. User completes payment
5. Razorpay sends webhook notification
6. Backend verifies signature and updates order
7. Order status changes to CONFIRMED

### File Upload Flow
1. User selects file in frontend
2. Frontend sends multipart/form-data request
3. Backend validates file type and size
4. File is saved to organized directory structure
5. Database record created with metadata
6. File URL returned to frontend

### Real-Time Tracking Flow
1. User connects to WebSocket with JWT token
2. Connection authenticated and mapped to user ID
3. User subscribes to specific order
4. Backend emits events to order room
5. All subscribers receive real-time updates
6. Connection automatically cleaned up on disconnect
